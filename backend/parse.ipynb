      "Natural language processing (NLP) field has witnessed a substantial paradigm shift with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models, distinguished by their considerable size and comprehensive training data, have demonstrated extraordinary abilities in comprehending and pro- ducing human-like text. In contrast to pre-trained language models dedicated to text understanding, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), the GPT series (Radford et al., 2018) accentuates text generation, positioning them as more suitable platforms for creativity compared to their counterparts. Notably, the latest members of the GPT family, namely ChatGPT and GPT-4, have garnered significant atten- tion, establishing themselves as leading examples in this rapidly evolving field.\n",

      "ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), evolved from InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), serves as an advanced conversational AI model capable of conducting context-aware, human-like interactions. Its success set the stage for the development of GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), a more sophisticated LLM, demonstrat- ing even greater potential in natural language understanding, generation, and various NLP tasks, especially for its multi-modal and reasoning abilities. These models have catalyzed new research directions and applications, intensifying interest in exploring the potential of Artificial General In- telligence (AGI). Exhibiting impressive performance across multiple benchmarks, they have also demonstrated capabilities for few-shot learning and adaptability to new tasks, significantly driving the expansion of NLP research. Consequently, they have inspired both researchers and industry pro- fessionals to further harness their potential across a wide array of applications, including sentiment analysis, machine translation, question-answering systems, and more.\n",

      "However, as impactful as LLMs have been, their implementation comes with inherent limitations that hamper transparent and open research. A major concern is their proprietary nature, which restricts access to the models, thus inhibiting the broader research community’s ability to build upon their successes. Furthermore, the vast computational resources necessary for training and deploying these models present a challenge for researchers with limited resources, further compounding the accessibility problem.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "To tackle these limitations, the NLP research community has gravitated towards open-source alter- natives to promote greater transparency and collaboration. LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023a) serve as notable examples of such initia- tives. These open-source LLMs are intended to facilitate academic research and accelerate progress within the NLP field. The aim of open-sourcing these models is to foster an environment conducive to further advancements in model development, fine-tuning, and evaluation, ultimately leading to the creation of robust, capable LLMs applicable to a wide variety of uses.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Despite the considerable strides made by LLaMA and Alpaca in NLP, they exhibit inherent limita- tions concerning native support for Chinese language tasks. Their vocabularies contain only a few hundred Chinese tokens, substantially hindering their efficiency in encoding and decoding Chinese text. Building on our previous work with the Chinese BERT series (Cui et al., 2021) and Chinese minority-oriented multilingual pre-trained models (Yang et al., 2022), in this technical report, we propose the development of Chinese LLaMA and Alpaca models with enhanced capabilities for understanding and generating Chinese content. We extend the original LLaMA’s vocabulary with an additional 20,000 Chinese tokens, significantly improving its proficiency in processing and gen- erating Chinese text. To ensure efficient training and deployment of these models, we employ the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach (Hu et al., 2021), enabling us to train and fine-tune the models without excessive computational costs. We anticipate our preliminary study to enhance the Chinese understanding and generation capabilities of LLaMA and Alpaca serves as a foundation for researchers aiming to adapt these models to other languages. By showcasing the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we offer insights and methodologies that can be employed to extend vocabularies and improve the performance of LLaMA and Alpaca models in various languages.

      "-------\n",
      "2.1 BACKGROUND\n",
      "-------\n",
      "LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) is a foundational, decoder-only large language model built upon the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Similar to the GPT series and other transformer- based LLMs, LLaMA consists of an embedding layer, multiple transformer blocks, and a language model head. LLaMA also incorporates improvements utilized in different models, such as pre- normalization (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019), SwiGLU activation (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary embed- dings (Su et al., 2021). LLaMA is available in four different model sizes: 7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "LLaMA has been pre-trained with a standard language modeling task (see Section 2.4) using a mix of publicly available sources, such as crawled web pages, books, Wikipedia, and preprint pa- pers. Experimental findings reveal that LLaMA delivers competitive performance compared to other LLMs like GPT-3, albeit at a smaller model size. This compactness and effectiveness have garnered considerable attention from researchers, leading to the widespread use of LLaMA-based models.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "2.2 CHINESE VOCABULARY EXTENSION\n",
      "-------\n",
      "LLaMA’s training set encompasses roughly 1.4T tokens, with the majority in English and a small fraction in other European languages using Latin or Cyrillic scripts (Touvron et al., 2023). Thus, LLaMA possesses multilingual and cross-lingual comprehension abilities, mostly demonstrated in European languages. Interestingly, our prior preliminary study reveals that LLaMA exhibits basic Chinese understanding ability, although its capacity to generate Chinese texts is limited.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "To equip LLaMA with enhanced Chinese understanding and generation capabilities, we propose to continue pre-training the LLaMA model with Chinese corpora. However, directly applying contin- ual pre-training with Chinese corpora encounters several challenges. Firstly, the original LLaMA vocabulary covers less than a thousand Chinese characters, which is insufficient to encode gen- eral Chinese texts. Although the LLaMA tokenizer circumvents this issue by tokenizing unknown UTF-8 characters to bytes, this strategy significantly extends sequence length and slows down the encoding and decoding efficiency of Chinese texts, as each Chinese character splits into 3-4 byte tokens. Secondly, byte tokens are not exclusively designed to represent Chinese characters. Since byte tokens also signify UTF-8 tokens in other languages, it becomes challenging for byte tokens and transformer encoders to effectively learn representations capturing the semantic meaning of Chinese characters.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "To address these problems and improve encoding efficiency, we propose to extend LLaMA vocab- ulary with additional Chinese tokens and adapt the model for the extended vocabulary (Yang et al., 2022). The extension process proceeds as follows:\n",

      "Technical Report\n",
      "-------\n",
      "To enhance the tokenizer’s support for Chinese texts, we initially train a Chinese tokenizer with SentencePiece (Kudo & Richardson, 2018) on Chinese corpora3 with a vocabulary size of 20,000.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "We subsequently merge the Chinese tokenizer into the original LLaMA tokenizer by taking the union of their vocabularies. Consequently, we obtain a merged tokenizer, which we term the Chinese LLaMA tokenizer, with a vocabulary size of 49,953.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "To adapt the LLaMA model for the Chinese LLaMA tokenizer, we resize the word embeddings and language model head from shape V × H to V ′ × H, where V = 32, 000 denotes the original vocabulary size, and V ′ = 49, 953 is the new vocabulary size of the Chinese LLaMA tokenizer. The new rows are appended to the end of the original embedding matrices, ensuring that the embeddings of the tokens in the original vocabulary remain unaffected.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Preliminary experiments indicate that the number of tokens generated by the Chinese LLaMA tok- enizer is approximately half of those generated by the original LLaMA tokenizer. Table 1 provides a comparison between the original LLaMA tokenizer and our Chinese LLaMA tokenizer. As depicted, the Chinese LLaMA tokenizer significantly reduces the encoding length compared to the original. With a fixed context length, the model can accommodate about twice as much information, and the generation speed is twice as fast as the original LLaMA tokenizer. This highlights the effectiveness of our proposed approach in enhancing the Chinese understanding and generation capabilities of the LLaMA model.\n",

      "The conventional training paradigm that updates the full parameters of LLMs is prohibitively expen- sive and is not time- or cost-feasible to most labs or companies. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2021) is a parameter-efficient training method that maintains the pre-trained model weights while introducing trainable rank decomposition matrices. LoRA freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable low-rank matrices into each layer. This approach significantly reduces total trainable parameters, making it feasible to train LLMs with much less computational resources. To be specific, for a linear layer with weight matrix W0 ∈ Rd×k, where k is the input dimension, and d is the output dimension, LoRA adds two low-rank decomposed trainable matrices B ∈ Rd×r and A ∈ Rr×k, where r is the pre-determined rank. The forward pass with input x is given by the following equation,\n",

      "h = W0x + ∆W x = W0x + BAx, B ∈ Rd×r, A ∈ Rr×d\n",

      "During training, W0 is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, while B and A are updated. By choosing the rank r ≪ min(d, k), the memory consumption is reduced as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the large frozen matrix.\n",

      "-------\n",
      "Pre-trained language models can hardly follow user instructions and often generate unintended con- tent. This is because the language modeling objective in Equation (2) is predicting the next token, not “follow the instructions and answer the questions” (Ouyang et al., 2022). To align the behavior of language models to the user’s intention, one can fine-tune the model to explicitly train it to follow instructions. Stanford Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023b) is a LLaMA-based instruction-following model that was trained on 52K instruction-following data generated by the techniques in the Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022). We follow the approach in Stanford Alpaca to apply self-instructed fine-tuning on Chinese LLaMA to train an instruction-following model — Chinese Alpaca.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Chinese Alpaca is trained on a combination of instruction-following datasets. Each example in the dataset consists of an instruction and an output. The supervised fine-tuning task is similar to the causal language modeling task: the model is prompted with the instruction and trained to generate the output autoregressively.

We adopt the following template from Stanford Alpaca for fine-tuning and inference, and the input sequence looks like:\n",

In stage 1, we fix the parameters of the transformer encoders within the model and only train the embeddings, adapting the newly added Chinese word vectors while minimizing the disturbance to the original model. In stage 2, we add LoRA weights (adapters) to the attention mechanisms and train the embeddings, LM heads, and newly added LoRA parameters. Note that two-stage training is not applied to other model training as it is less efficient in our preliminary study.\n",

Following previous work that utilizes GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) as a scoring method, we also adopt GPT-4 to provide an overall score (on a 10-point scale) for each sample, which is more efficient than human evaluation. How- ever, GPT-4 may not always provide accurate scores, so we perform manual checks on its ratings and adjust them if necessary. The manual checks ensure that the scores are consistent and reflect the true performance of the models being evaluated. We use the following prompt template for scoring two outputs of the systems (which can be adjusted to multiple systems):\n",

      "The decoding process of LLMs plays a critical role in determining the quality and diversity of the generated text. In our experiments, we use the following decoding hyperparameters:\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Context size: We set the context size to 2048, which determines the maximum number of tokens the model can consider simultaneously when generating text.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Maximum sequence length: We limit the generated sequence length to 512 tokens to ensure that the outputs remain focused and relevant to the input prompt.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Temperature: We set the temperature to 0.2, which controls the randomness of the sampling process. Lower values make the model generate more focused and deterministic outputs, while higher values increase diversity at the cost of coherence. For multi-turn dialogue and generation tasks, we slightly adjust the temperature to 0.5 to allow a more diverse output.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Top-k sampling: We use Top-k sampling with k = 40, meaning that the model selects its next token from the top 40 most probable tokens at each step, adding an element of randomness and diversity to the generated text.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Top-p sampling: We also employ Top-p sampling with p = 0.9, which further enhances diver- sity by considering a dynamic set of tokens that collectively account for 90% of the probability mass.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Repetition penalty: To discourage the model from generating repetitive text, we apply a repeti- tion penalty with a factor of 1.1, penalizing tokens that have already been selected.\n",

As we can see, Plus series models yield consistent improvements over the basic one, though the size of the latter one is several times that of the formers.

Table 5 shows an example of a text generation task. We can see that both Alpaca-Plus-7B and Alpaca-Plus-13B provide correct letter styles, which meet the requirement of the user’s prompt. Alpaca-Plus-13B provides the most comprehensive one by indicating that the applicant has thoroughly prepared all materials for visa application, making it the best generation quality among all three systems. How- ever, Alpaca-33B does not follow the letter style, and the content is somewhat too simplified, which is clearly not as good as the others.

As we can see, the Alpaca-33B achieves significant improvements over Plus-7B and Plus-13B models. Table 6 shows example outputs for this task. The first prompt is well-known for probing the reasoning ability, namely “which one is heavier, 1kg of cotton or 1kg of iron?”. Both Plus-7B and Plus-13B failed to give a correct answer mentioning that “cotton is lighter than iron”. However, 33B could correctly identify that these two things are the same weight. The second prompt is a simple calculation task, asking “how many legs for a cat and a chicken”. However, as we can see, both Plus-7B and Plus-13B do not have the commonsense knowledge that a cat has four legs and two for a chicken, resulting in wrong answers. The last prompt is a numerical reasoning task to let the model predict the next number of an array. Still, only 33B model correctly identifies the pattern of the given array that the next number should be the square of its index. These observations indicate that the size of the model is vital in numerical reasoning tasks.\n",

Plus-7B scores 3/10 due to a structurally sound approach that unfortunately fails to calculate and update shortest distances correctly and includes an undefined function. Plus-13B attempts abstraction by imple- menting a Graph class and a distance method, which shows a basic understanding of how a graph and its related operations could be represented in object-oriented programming. Also, the fact that it is attempting to implement a shortest path algorithm (despite not correctly implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm) makes it a slightly higher score than Plus-7B’s. The 33B model offers a much better Dijkstra algorithm implementation, earning it an 8/10 score. Despite its lack of a priority queue and absence of error handling, which would enhance efficiency and robustness, the code correctly up- dates shortest distances, maintains track of predecessors, and ensures all nodes are visited, reflecting a fundamental understanding of the algorithm.\n",

Among different settings, such as zero-shot or 5-shot, the Alpaca model series show significant improvements over LLaMA coun- terparts, demonstrating that the instruction-following models are more capable of handling these NLU-like tasks than pure language models. Unlike the phenomenon observed in the LLaMA series, we can see that Alpaca-Plus models yield significant improvement over basic Alpaca models. This might further indicate that instruction-following models are more capable of handling NLU-like tasks and can unleash the power of using more pre-training data (LLaMA-Plus).\n",

Generally speaking, LLaMA with 5-shot setting shows better performance than zero-shot setting, while Alpaca with zero-shot setting is much better than 5-shot one. As LLaMA is not de- signed for instruction-following, few-shot setting might give valuable information on how to follow the question answering structure in C-Eval. However, on the contrary, as Alpaca has already been trained with millions of instruction data, it is less likely to benefit from additional shots.

      "6 EFFECT OF DIFFERENT QUANTIZATION METHODS\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Deploying large language models on personal computers, particularly on CPUs, has historically been challenging due to their immense computational requirements. However, with the help of many community efforts, such as llama.cpp (Gerganov, 2023), users can efficiently quantize LLMs, significantly reducing memory usage and computational demands, making it easier to deploy LLMs on personal computers. This also enables quicker interactions with the models and facilitates local data processing. Quantizing LLMs and deploying them on personal computers offer several benefits. Firstly, it helps users protect their data privacy by ensuring that sensitive information remains within their local environment rather than being transmitted to external servers. Secondly, it democratizes access to LLMs by making them more accessible to users with limited computational resources. Lastly, it promotes the development of new applications and research directions that take advantage of local LLM deployments. Overall, the ability to deploy LLMs on personal computers using llama.cpp (or similar) paves the way for a more versatile and privacy-conscious utilization of LLMs in various domains.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "In this section, we investigate the effect of different quantization methods. We use llama.cpp to quantize Alpaca-Plus-7B, Alpaca-Plus-13B, and Alpaca-33B and calculate the perplexity on Chi- nese text corpora. We quantize these models into 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit forms to compare with the original FP16 one.10 The results are shown in Figure 4.\n",

      "-------\n",
      "The quantization level is strictly bound to the memory usage and inference speed, and thus a trade- off must be made when choosing a proper quantization level. As we can see, the 8-bit quantization method has almost the same or even lower perplexities compared to the original FP16 model, demon- strating that it is a good choice for deploying LLMs on personal computers, with only half size of the FP16 one. The 6-bit models also achieve decent PPLs comparable to the 8-bit one, making it a better balance of speed and performance. When we use a more aggressive quantization level, the performance drastically decreases (i.e., higher PPL), especially for 3-bit and 2-bit. We also discover that larger models are less sensitive to quantization methods than smaller ones. For example, the performance of 33B models changes much more mildly than the others. A similar result is also observed when comparing Plus-7B and Plus-13B models. This might indicate that though 2-bit and 3-bit quantization are less effective for smaller models, it might be a promising way to deploy larger models without significant performance loss. This is extremely helpful when the users only have limited computing resources and still want to try large language models. This might also imply that the quantized training method may become a main-stream approach for training large language models, especially for those with limited training resources.\n",

      "7 CONCLUSION\n",
      "-------\n",
      "In this technical report, we have presented an approach to enhance the Chinese understanding and generation capabilities of the LLaMA model. Acknowledging the limitations of the original LLaMA’s Chinese vocabulary, we expanded it by incorporating 20K additional Chinese tokens, sig- nificantly increasing its encoding efficiency for the Chinese language. Building on the Chinese LLaMA, we employed supervised fine-tuning with instruction data, resulting in Chinese Alpaca models exhibiting improved instruction-following capabilities.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "To evaluate our models effectively, we annotated 200 samples across ten distinct task types and utilized GPT-4 for evaluation. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed models significantly outperformed the original LLaMA in Chinese understanding and generation tasks. We also tested our models on C-Eval datasets. The results show that the proposed model could achieve significant improvements and show competitive performance to the models with several times bigger sizes.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Looking ahead, we plan to explore Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Re- inforcement Learning from AI Instructed Feedback (RLAIF) to further align the models’ output with human preferences. Moreover, we intend to adopt more advanced and effective quantization methods, such as GPTQ (Frantar et al., 2022), among others.

      "LIMITATIONS\n",
      "-------\n",
      "While this project has successfully enhanced the Chinese understanding and generation capabilities of the LLaMA and Alpaca models, several limitations must be acknowledged:\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Harmful and unpredictable content: Though our model can reject unethical queries, these mod- els may still generate harmful or misaligned with human preferences and values. This issue may arise from biases in the training data or the models’ inability to discern appropriate outputs in certain contexts.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Insufficient training: Due to constraints in computing power and data availability, the training of the models may not be sufficient for optimal performance. As a result, there is still room for improvement in the Chinese understanding capabilities of the models.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Lack of robustness: The models may exhibit brittleness in some situations, producing incon- sistent or nonsensical outputs when faced with adversarial inputs or rare language phenomena.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Comprehensive evaluation: Evaluating large language models is an important topic in the cur- rent era. While we have seen many evaluation benchmarks for LLMs, their comprehensiveness and appropriateness for LLMs should be well-studied and examined. A more diverse and com- prehensive LLM evaluation dataset and benchmark will have a great positive effect on shaping the future of LLM research.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Scalability and efficiency: Although we applied LoRA and quantization to make the model more accessible to a broader community, when combined with the original LLaMA, the mod- els’ large size and complexity can lead to difficulties in deployment, especially for users with limited computational resources. This issue may hinder the accessibility and widespread adop- tion of the models in various applications.\n",
      "-------\n",
