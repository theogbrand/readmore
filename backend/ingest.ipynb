      "of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4 [Ope23], was trained using an\n",
      "unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version\n",
      "of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-\n",
      "4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google’s PaLM for example) that exhibit\n",
      "more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of\n",
      "these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and diﬃcult\n",
      "tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any\n",
      "special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4’s performance is strikingly close to human-level\n",
      "performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of\n",
      "GPT-4’s capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version\n",
      "of an artiﬁcial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis\n",

      "algebraic manipulations are likely to be relevant at each stage, in order to chart a path towards the\n",
      "solution. This component is often based on a heuristic guess (or in the case of humans, intuition), and\n",

      "2.Technical proﬁciency: The ability to perform routine calculations or manipulations that follow a\n",
      "prescribed set of steps (such as diﬀerentiating a function or isolating a term in an equation).\n",
      "3.Critical reasoning: The ability to critically examine each step of the argument, break it down into\n",

      "Creative reasoning. When it comes to advanced high-school level problems (and occasionally higher\n",

      "The ability to explain one’s own behavior is an important aspect of intelligence, as it allows for a system\n",
      "to communicate with humans and other agents. Self explanation is not only a form of communication, but\n",
      "also a form of reasoning, requiring a good theory of mind for both yourself (the explainer) and the listener.\n",

      "accordingly, as illustrated by the third session where we force the output to be “1400”. As these examples\n",

      "inconsistencies between the generated content and the prompt, which we referred to as open-domain\n",

      "is also promising, see Figure 1.8 for an example. Finally, building the user experience of an application\n",
      "with the possibility of hallucinations in mind can also be part of an eﬀective mitigation strategy.\n",

      "unicorn and smiles.\n",
      "- Write the dialogue and captions for each panel, using simple and expressive language that matches the\n",

      "humor, such as \"Scribble, scribble\", \"Poof!\", and \"Neigh!\"\n",
      "- Draw the characters and backgrounds for each panel, using a clear and colorful style that appeals to\n",
      "little girls. For example, you could make the girl cute and expressive, with big eyes, long hair, and a\n",
      "dress, and the unicorn majestic and friendly, with a horn, a mane, and a tail. You could also add some\n",
      "details and accessories to make them more unique and interesting, such as a flower in the girl’s hair, a\n",
      "star on the unicorn’s forehead, or a poster of a fairy tale on the wall.\n",
      "- Ink and color the panels, using a pen, a brush, or a digital tool to outline and fill in the\n",
      "shapes and textures. For example, you could use black ink for the outlines, and bright colors for the\n",
      "characters and backgrounds, such as pink, purple, and blue. You could also use some shading, highlights,\n",
      "and patterns to create some depth and contrast, such as a gradient for the sky, a sparkle for the magic\n",
      "crayon, or a stripe for the unicorn’s coat.\n",
      "- Add the dialogue and captions, using a font, a lettering, or a handwriting that fits the style and\n",

Our work is related to the\\nfollowing broad research directions:\\nLearning mathematical structures [5] trains a neural network to learn arithmetic operation from\\npictures of digits, but they do not observe grokking due to their abundant training data. Beyond\\narithmetic relations, machine learning has been applied to learn other mathematical structures,\\nincluding geometry [6], knot theory [7] and group theory [8].\\nDouble descent Grokking is somewhat reminiscent of the phenomena of “epoch-wise” double\\ndescent [9], where generalization can improve after a period of overﬁtting. [ 10] ﬁnd that regularization\\ncan mitigate double descent, similar perhaps to how weight decay inﬂuences grokking.\\nRepresentation learning Representation learning lies at the core of machine learning [ 11–14].\\nRepresentation quality is usually measured by (perhaps vague) semantic meanings or performance on\\ndownstream tasks. In our study, the simplicity of arithmetic datasets allows us to deﬁne representation\\nquality and study evolution of representations in a quantitative way.\\nPhysics of learning Physics-inspired tools have proved to be useful in understanding deep learning\\nfrom a theoretical perspective. These tools include effective theories [ 15,16], conservation laws [ 17]\\nand free energy principle [ 18]. In addition, statistical physics has been identiﬁed as a powerful tool in\\nstudying generalization in neural networks [ 19–22]. Our work connects a low-level understanding of\\nmodels with their high-level performance. In a recent work, researchers at Anthropic [ 23], connect a\\nsudden decrease in loss during training with the emergence of induction heads within their models.\\nThey analogize their work to statistical physics , since it bridges a “microscopic”, mechanistic\\nunderstanding of networks with “macroscopic” facts about overall model performance.',\n",
       "  'Power et al. [ 1] observe grokking on a less common task – learning “algorithmic” binary operations.\\nGiven some binary operation ◦, a network is tasked with learning the map (a,b)↦→cwherec=a◦b.\\nThey use a decoder-only transformer to predict the second to last token in a tokenized equation of the\\nform “<lhs> <op> <rhs> <eq> <result> <eos>”. Each token is represented as a 256-dimensional\\nembedding vector. The embeddings are learnable and initialized randomly. After the transformer, a\\nﬁnal linear layer maps the output to class logits for each token.\\nToy Model We primarily study grokking in a simpler toy model, which still retains the key behaviors\\nfrom the setup of [ 1]. Although [ 1] treated this as a classiﬁcation task, we study both regression\\n(mean-squared error) and classiﬁcation (cross-entropy). The basic setup is as follows: our model\\ntakes as input the symbols a,band maps them to trainable embedding vectors Ea,Eb∈Rdin. It\\nthen sums Ea,Eband sends the resulting vector through a “decoder” MLP. The target output vector,\\ndenoted Yc∈Rdoutis a ﬁxed random vector (regression task) or a one-hot vector (classiﬁcation\\ntask). Our model architecture can therefore be compactly described as (a,b)↦→Dec(Ea+Eb),\\nwhere the embeddings E∗and the decoder are trainable. Despite its simplicity, this toy model can\\ngeneralize to all abelian groups (discussed in Appendix B). In sections 3-4.1, we consider only the\\nbinary operation of addition. We consider modular addition in Section 4.2 to generalize some of our\\nresults to a transformer architecture and study general non-abelian operations in Appendix H.\\nDataset In our toy setting, we are concerned with learning the addition operation.

       "  '\\nWe aim to understand grokking , a phenomenon where models generalize long after\\noverﬁtting their training set. We present both a microscopic analysis anchored by an\\neffective theory and a macroscopic analysis of phase diagrams describing learning\\nperformance across hyperparameters. We ﬁnd that generalization originates from\\nstructured representations whose training dynamics and dependence on training set\\nsize can be predicted by our effective theory in a toy setting. We observe empirically\\nthe presence of four learning phases: comprehension ,grokking ,memorization , and\\nconfusion . We ﬁnd representation learning to occur only in a “Goldilocks zone”\\n(including comprehension and grokking) between memorization and confusion.\\nWe ﬁnd on transformers the grokking phase stays closer to the memorization phase\\n(compared to the comprehension phase), leading to delayed generalization. The\\nGoldilocks phase is reminiscent of “intelligence from starvation” in Darwinian\\nevolution, where resource limitations drive discovery of more efﬁcient solutions.\\nThis study not only provides intuitive explanations of the origin of grokking, but\\nalso highlights the usefulness of physics-inspired tools, e.g., effective theories and\\nphase diagrams, for understanding deep learning.',\n",
       "  'Perhaps thecentral challenge of a scientiﬁc understanding of deep learning lies in accounting for neu-\\nral network generalization. Power et al. [ 1] recently added a new puzzle to the task of understanding\\ngeneralization with their discovery of grokking . Grokking refers to the surprising phenomenon of\\ndelayed generalization where neural networks, on certain learning problems, generalize long after\\noverﬁtting their training set. It is a rare albeit striking phenomenon that violates common machine\\nlearning intuitions, raising three key puzzles:\\nQ1The origin of generalization : When trained on the algorithmic datasets where grokking occurs,\\nhow do models generalize at all?\\nQ2The critical training size : Why does the training time needed to “grok” (generalize) diverge as\\nthe training set size decreases toward a critical point?\\nQ3Delayed generalization : Under what conditions does delayed generalization occur?\\nWe provide evidence that representation learning is central to answering each of these questions. Our\\nanswers can be summarized as follows:\\nA1Generalization can be attributed to learning a good representation of the input embeddings,\\ni.e., a representation that has the appropriate structure for the task and which can be predicted\\nfrom the theory in Section 3. See Figures 1 and 2.\\nA2The critical training set size corresponds to the least amount of training data that can determine\\nsuch a representation (which, in some cases, is unique up to linear transformations).\\n36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).arXiv:2205.10343v2  [cs.LG]  14 Oct 2022Initialization (0 iterations)\\ntrain acc: 0.0 — val acc: 0.0Overﬁtting (1000 iterations)\\ntrain acc: 1.0 — val acc: 0.1Representation Learning (20000 iterations)\\ntrain acc: 1.0 — val acc: 1.0Figure 1: Visualization of the ﬁrst two principal components of the learned input embeddings at\\ndifferent training stages of a transformer learning modular addition.

In Section 3, we will use an effective theory approach, a useful tool from\\ntheoretical physics, to shed some light on questions Q1andQ2and show the relationship between\\ngeneralization and the learning of structured representations. In Section 4, we explain Q3by\\ndisplaying phase diagrams from a grid search of hyperparameters and show how we can “de-delay”\\ngeneralization by following intuition developed from the phase diagram. We discuss related work in\\nSection 5, followed by conclusions in Section 6.1',\n",

       "  'We can see that generalization appears to be linked to the emergence of highly-structured embeddings\\nin Figure 2. In particular, Figure 2 (a, b) shows parallelograms in toy addition, and (c, d) shows a\\ncircle in toy modular addition.

In Section 4, we explain Q3by\\ndisplaying phase diagrams from a grid search of hyperparameters and show how we can “de-delay”\\ngeneralization by following intuition developed from the phase diagram. We discuss related work in\\nSection 5, followed by conclusions in Section 6.1',\n",

       " 'Perhaps thecentral challenge of a scientiﬁc understanding of deep learning lies in accounting for neu-\\nral network generalization. Power et al. [ 1] recently added a new puzzle to the task of understanding\\ngeneralization with their discovery of grokking . Grokking refers to the surprising phenomenon of\\ndelayed generalization where neural networks, on certain learning problems, generalize long after\\noverﬁtting their training set. It is a rare albeit striking phenomenon that violates common machine\\nlearning intuitions, raising three key puzzles:\\nQ1The origin of generalization : When trained on the algorithmic datasets where grokking occurs,\\nhow do models generalize at all?\\nQ2The critical training size : Why does the training time needed to “grok” (generalize) diverge as\\nthe training set size decreases toward a critical point?\\nQ3Delayed generalization : Under what conditions does delayed generalization occur?\\nWe provide evidence that representation learning is central to answering each of these questions. Our\\nanswers can be summarized as follows:\\nA1Generalization can be attributed to learning a good representation of the input embeddings,\\ni.e., a representation that has the appropriate structure for the task and which can be predicted\\nfrom the theory in Section 3. See Figures 1 and 2.\\nA2The critical training set size corresponds to the least amount of training data that can determine\\nsuch a representation (which, in some cases, is unique up to linear transformations).\\n36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).arXiv:2205.10343v2  [cs.LG]  14 Oct 2022Initialization (0 iterations)\\ntrain acc: 0.0 — val acc: 0.0Overﬁtting (1000 iterations)\\ntrain acc: 1.0 — val acc: 0.1Representation Learning (20000 iterations)\\ntrain acc: 1.0 — val acc: 1.0Figure 1: Visualization of the ﬁrst two principal components of the learned input embeddings at\\ndifferent training stages of a transformer learning modular addition.
